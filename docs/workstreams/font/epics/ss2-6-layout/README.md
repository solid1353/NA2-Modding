# ss1–ss6 layout parity

User-declared Font epic covering the matched NUN5/NA2.28 savestate pairs in
slots 1 through 6. Slots 2–6 formed the original declaration; the user added
the remade Special Controls slot 1 pair on 2026-07-27. The epic runs in an
efficiency-prioritized sequential mode: implement one slot, commit and push it, present its
NUN5-left/Current-NA2-right result, then wait for explicit user acceptance
before beginning the next slot.

## Scope and evidence

- Declared: 2026-07-27.
- Inputs:
  `work/Font/inputs/sstates/epics/ss2-6/`.
- Extracted source screenshots:
  `work/Font/inputs/screenshots/epics/ss2-6/`.
- Provenance:
  `work/Font/inputs/sstates/epics/ss2-6/provenance.tsv`.
- Protected `@pcsx2_user` sources remain untouched.
- Status: the remade ss2 and ss3 pair records the same Pause Controls modal in
  normal and selected states. Both are user-verified and removed from the
  remaining report. The shared quit-confirmation and ss1 Special Controls cases
  are also user-verified and removed; two epic cases remain.
- Existing accepted Font and resident-renderer behavior remains the regression
  baseline. The previously retained Command Chart ss2 image was superseded by
  the remade Pause Controls ss2 state and is no longer an epic input.
- Text-content differences are normally routed to the translation workstreams.

## Collection

### ss5 — Character model move list

- State: baseline captured; not implemented.
- Remaining defect: Current overflows the long move name, while NUN5 wraps it
  inside the right-side column.

### ss6 — Movie list

- State: baseline captured; not implemented.
- Remaining defect: Current movie titles remain single-line and overflow,
  while NUN5 uses variable-height wrapped rows.

## Efficiency-prioritized sequential plan

1. **ss5 — Character model move list.** Add bounded wrapping and positioning
   for the right-side move-name column.
2. **ss6 — Movie list.** Implement variable-height wrapped rows last because
   this case has the greatest caller-specific row-advance and layout burden.

Shared primitives are implemented only once. Each slot still receives its own
guarded caller, commit/push boundary, result grid, and explicit acceptance; a
shared implementation does not merge the six review decisions.
